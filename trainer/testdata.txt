Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink,
a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia,
a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin
and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement
and weedy lots and junk-heaps, sardine canneries of corru-
gated iron, honky-tonks, restaurants and whore-houses, and
little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flop-houses. Its
inhabitants are, as the man once said, “whores, pimps,
gamblers, and sons of bitches,” by which he meant Every-
body. Had the man looked through another peep-hole he
might have said : “Saints and angels and martyrs and holy
men,” and he would have meant the same thing.

In the morning when the sardine fleet has made a catch,
the purse-seiners waddle heavily into the bay blowing their
whistles. The deep-laden boats pull in against the coast
where the canneries dip their tails into the bay. The figure
is advisedly chosen, for if the canneries dipped their mouths
into the bay the canned sardines which emerge from the
other end would be metaphorically, at least, even more horri-
fying. Then cannery whistles scream and all over the town
men and women scramble into their clothes and come run-
ning down to the Row to go to work. Then shining cars
bring the upper classes down : superintendents, accountants,
owners who disappear into offices. Then from the town pour
Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women in
trousers and rubber coats and oilcloth aprons. They come
running to clean and cut and pack and cook and can the
fish. The whole street rumbles and groans and screams and
rattles while the silver rivers of fish pour in out of the boats
and the boats rise higher and higher in the water until they
are empty. The canneries rumble and rattle and squeak
until the last fish is cleaned and cut and cooked and canned
and then the whistles scream again and the dripping, smelly,
tired Wops and Chinamen and Polaks, men and women,
straggle out and droop their ways up the hill into the town

and Cannery Row becomes itself again — quiet and magical.
Its normal life returns. The bums who retired in disgust
under the black cypress-tree come out to sit on the rusty
pipes in the vacant lot. The ^Is from Dora’s emerge for a
bit of sun if there is any. Doc strolls from the Western
Biological Laboratory and crosses the street to Lee Chong’s
grocery for two quarts of beer. Henri the painter noses like
an Airedale through the junk in the grass-grown lot for
some part or piece of wood or metal he needs for the boat
he is building. Then the darkness edges in and the street
light comes on in front of Dora’s — the lamp which makes
perpetual moonlight in Cannery Row. Callers arrive at
Western Biological to see Doc, and he crosses the street to
Lee Chong’s for five quarts of beer.

How can the poem and the stink and the grating noise —
the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream —
be set down alive? When you collect marine animals there
are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost im-
possible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under
the touch. You must let them ooze and crawl of their own
will on to a knife blade and then lift them gently into
your bottle of sea water. And perhaps that might be the
way to write this book — to open the page and to let the
stories crawl in by themselves.

CHAPTER I


Lee Chong’s grocery, wliile not a model of neatness, was
a miracle of supply. It was small and crowded but within
its single room a man could find everything he needed or
wanted to live and to be happy — clothes, food, both fresh
and canned, liquor, tobacco, fishing equipment, machinery,
boats, cordage, caps, pork-diops. You could buy at Lee
Chong’s a pair of slippers, a silk kimono, a quarter-pint of
whisky and a cigar. You could work out combinations to
fit almost any mood. The one commodity Lee Chong did
not keep could be had across the lot at Dora’s.

The grocery opened at dawn and did not close until the
last wandering vagrant dime had been spent or retired for
the night. Not that Lee Chong was avaricious. He wasn’t,
but if one wanted to spend money, he was available. Lee’s
position in the community surprised him as much*as he
could be surprised. Over the course of the years everyone
in Cannery Row owed him money. He never pressed his
clients, but when the bill became too large, Lee cut o£E
credit. Rather than walk into the town up the hill, the
client usually paid or tried to.

Lee was roumd-faced and courteous. He spoke a stately
English without ever using the letter R. When the tong
wars were going on in California, it happened now and then
that Lee found a price on his head. Then he would go
secretly to San Francisco and enter a hospital until the
trouble blew over. What he did with his money, no one
ever knew. Perhaps he didn’t get it. Maybe his wealth was
entirely in unpaid bills. But he lived well and he had the
respect of all his neighbours. He trusted his clients until
further trust became ridiculous. Sometimes he made busi-
ness errors, but even these he turned to advantage in good
will if in no other way. It was that way with the Palace
Flophouse and Grill. Anyone but Lee Chong would have
considered the transaction a total loss.

Lee Chong’s station in the grocery was behind the cigar
counter. The cash register was then on his left and the

abacus on his right. Inside the glass case were the brown
cigars, the cigarettes, the Bull Durham, the Duke’s mixture,
the Five Brothers, while behind him in racks on the wall
were the pints, half-pints and quarters of Old Green River,
Old Town House, Old Colonel, and the favourite — Old
Tennessee, a blended -whisky guaranteed four months old,
very cheap and known in the neighbourhood as Old Tennis
Shoes. Lee Chong did not stand between the whisky and
the customer without reason. Some very practical minds
had on occasion tried to divert his attention to another part
of the store. Cousins, nephews, sons and daughters-in-law
waited on the rest of the store, but Lee never left the cigar
counter. The top of the glass was his desk. His fat delicate
hands rested on the glass, the fingers moving like small rest-
less sausages. A broad golden wedding-ring on the middle
finger of his left hand was his only jewellery and with it
he silently tapped on the rubber change mat from which
the little rubber tits had long been worn. Lee’s mouth was
full and benevolent and the flash of gold when he smiled
was rich and warm. He wore half-glasses and since he
looked at everything through them, he had to tilt his head
back to see in the distance. Interest and discounts, addition,
subtraction he worked out on the abacus with his little rest-
less sausage fingers, and his brown friendly eyes roved over
the grocery and his teeth flashed at the customers.

On an evening when he stood in his place on a pad of news-
paper to keep his feet warm, he contemplated with humour
and sadness a business deal that had been consummated that
afternoon and reconsuramated later that same afternoon.
When you leave the grocery, if you walk catty-cornered
across the grass-grown lot, threading your way among the
great rusty pipes thrown out of the canneries, you will see
a path worn in the weeds. Follow it past the cypress-tree,
across the railroad track, up a chicken-walk with cleats, and
you will come to a long low building which for a long rime
was used as a storage place for fish meal. It was just a great
big roofed room and it belonged to a worried gentleman
named Horace Abbeville. Horace had two wives and six
children, and over a period of years he had managed through
